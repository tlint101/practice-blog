:::{#blog-heading}

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tony and I write this blog. I am currently in a Ph.D. program for drug discovery in
Taiwan. Why Taiwan? Well, a series of life choices fresh from university led me there, but I did not start the program until
late. I am, what you would call, a late bloomer. And still learning!

I will treat this as a place ot practice code and share my thinking and thought processes.

You can find my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/tlint101) for things that I will try in the future.

Any posts with code here will be in a Jupyter Notebook format and can be found [here](https://github.com/tlint101/practice-in-code)

Thanks for visiting!
