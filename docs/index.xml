<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="py50-generate-dose-response-curves">py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves</h3>
<p>I would like to announce a new project I have been working on: <a href="https://github.com/tlint101/py50">py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves</a>. It is the first “big” python project that I have worked on. This package will calculate IC50 (py50, get it? … Anyone?) and will plot the dose-response curves. And for anyone who does not know how to code, I created a Streamlit web application(<a href="https://py50-app.streamlit.app">click here</a>). I hope others will be able to find this useful for their own work.</p>
<section id="why-did-i-make-py50" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-did-i-make-py50">Why did I make py50?</h4>
<p>Well, this was mostly for myself. I am lucky to be in a lab that has close collaborations with other labs, meaning that my work can quickly be shared with experts in other areas. They will generate the dose-response curves for me. But sometimes when I organize my figures, I realized that the curves do not fit my style. The color does not match my docking pose, or my protein, or the font could be bigger, etc. Now, I could ask them to change it, but I do not like to be a burden on people. They spent a lot of time doing this work, the least I could do is learn the program they used to generate plot, right?</p>
<p>Well, the truth is I hate using their program (which I will not name here)!</p>
<p>So I went about creating my own. As a python module, it can be customizable to anyone’s workflow. The outcome is perfect for me. After I showed this to my advisor, he made the comment that it would be good for others to use. And I realized that I could easily convert the code for this purpose.</p>
<p>For py50, I have a KNIME workflow. That is available upon request. It is not as elegant, as they are not custom KNIME nodes, so I am a little more reserved in sharing that workflow. Another issue with KNIME is that it would require the user to have python installed on their machine. I realized that could be a hassle. So I also created a Streamlit web application. Using Streamlit has been on my list of things to try for a very long time, and I am glad that with my py50 project, I was able to do that.</p>
<p>The code is not perfect. There is a lot that I need to clean up on the backend. But for what I have, it works and I learned a lot. I am very surprised I got a decent package up and running. The plan is to maintain this for the foreseeable future. And, if the inspiration is right, I will add some extra features over the coming years.</p>
<p>The next few posts will dive into details about py50, the functions, and concepts of IC50 that I ran into.</p>

  <title>Hello World - Now With Goals!</title>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hello-world---now-with-goals">Hello World - Now with Goals</h3>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Tony. I am currently in a Ph.D.&nbsp;program for drug discovery in Taiwan. Why Taiwan? Well, a series of life choices fresh from university led me there. I did not get a start into my field of study overnight. I am a late bloomer. And still learning. Or at least trying to!</p>
<p>I specialize in cheminformatics - using computers to sort and categorize molecules. There’s a lot of good software out there that can help anyone interested into getting into the field. That includes both paid versions, such as <a href="https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro">Schrodiner’s Maestro</a>, or open source software such as the wonderful suite available from the <a href="https://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/software-server-spgl.html">University of Hamburg</a>. Those tools are great! But I quickly realized that relying on software, as good as they can be, can be very limiting. What if I have an idea that does not fit the available software? What if I want to make modifications to the figures I make? What if I want to try a new screening protocol? There is only one way to do these things - coding! And learning to code requires a lot of practice.</p>
<p>I know that with experience. I have tried learning ot code multiple times in my life. Each time I have failed. There is a whole host of reasons. Maybe the language I chose was not for me. Java, is great, but at the time I can barely wrap my head around it. I tried making a small iOS app in the early days of the iPhone, which used UIKit. No dice. When Apple transitioned into Swift UI, I thought “Great! A new start!” Only to fail horribly.</p>
<p>It was not until I got into the Ph.D.&nbsp;program (and again, I started late!) that I finally tried and… well I did not succeed, but I got way further than before.</p>
<p>What helped was having a project and actually sticking with it. Well, what really helped is that I found a lot of examples online tackling similar problems I had. People writing about their code, sharing new tools and packages, and how to solve them. All of this helped make things simple enough for me to at least get started.</p>
<p>For that, I am forever grateful.</p>
<p><strong>That brings me to this blog. I will use it as a place to practice coding, my thinking and thought processes, what I am interested in, and hopefully, as a way to share with others.</strong></p>
<p>This will be my way of paying it forward.</p>
<p>And barring that, it will be a good place to showcase my failures to the world. I’m ok with that too.</p>
