    "section": "",
    "text": "Absolute IC50\nBe default, the calculate_ic50() method will calculate the relative IC50 value. Calculating the IC50 value can be ambiguous. A good introduction has been written up by Dr.¬†Keith Hornberger (Tweetorial: IC50 vs.¬†Ki). In the article, there are reasons given for why IC50 depends on many factors - the drug being tested, the conditions, which cell, etc. These can all have an influence on the final result. \n\nSo what is an IC50 value?\nOn the surface, this an easy and fundamental pharmacological concept for researchers to quickly gauge the potency of a drug - ü§î How much of my drug is needed to inhibit my target 50%. üí≠\nGraphically, it will look like a sigmoidal plot (see tutorial 001), where typically the Y-axis are the drug responses and the X-axis is the concentration. The X-axis is typically logarithmic in order to gauge the wide variations in the tested drug concentration. We will see that calculated IC50 can be just as ambiguous, especially if we do not specify the response value. That is when we get Relative vs.¬†Absolute values.\nWhat does Relative vs.¬†Absolute mean? GraphPad has a post explaining this problem: Relative vs.¬†Absolute IC50 and 50% of what? How exactly are Ic50 and EC50 defined?\n\nImage from GraphPad KNOWLEDGEBASE - ARTICLE #1566 (here)\nIn short, Relative IC50 is the concentration that brings the curve down to the point halfway between the top and the bottom plateaus of the curve. This is the most common definition. The problem is that the relative IC50 may not correlate to 50% response (Figure above). Ergo, if it is not explicitly stated that the reported IC50 is at 50% response, then it can be assumed that the reported value is ‚ÄúRelative‚Äù IC50.\nIn contrast, Absolute IC50 is value at the exact point where the target response is 50%. The figure above details this point with the horizontal lines. Keep in mind that the 50% mark can also be ambiguous. It may be best to use absolute IC50 values if the response can be properly converted to a percentage (0% - 100%). However, how this is done can differ between methods and assays.\nIn this tutorial, we will not be too concerted with these aspects. Instead, we will focus on ‚Äúweird‚Äù results that may result from the Relative vs Absolute IC50 calculation. Typically, this issue is a result of not having the recommended number of datapoints. We will explain further below. \n\n\nExample start\nFirst we will look at a ‚Äúgood example‚Äù. By this I mean there are enough points that can give a good representation of the plateau at both ends of the response. This is necessary to determine the general curve.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom py50.calculate import Calculate\nfrom py50.plotcurve import PlotCurve\n\n\ngood_example_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/py50/single_example.csv')\ngood_example = Calculate(good_example_df)\ngood_example.show().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n100000.0\n90\n94\n92\n\n\n1\nDrug 1\n33300.0\n97\n89\n93\n\n\n2\nDrug 1\n11100.0\n86\n89\n88\n\n\n3\nDrug 1\n3700.0\n81\n88\n84\n\n\n4\nDrug 1\n1240.0\n63\n70\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelative_ic50 = good_example.calculate_ic50(name_col='Compound Name', concentration_col='Compound Conc', response_col='% Inhibition Avg')\nrelative_ic50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound_name\nmaximum\nminimum\nic50 (nM)\nhill_slope\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n92.854428\n-7.640263\n439.823988\n1.040875\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we read in a .csv file. The current version of py50, only requires a column with the drug name, drug concentration, and response average. As seen in the previous tutorial, the IC50 can be calculated as a table using the ‚Äúcalculate_ic50‚Äù method. By default, the IC50 value is the Relative IC50 value.\nWe can double check the calculations if we like. There are two online IC50 calculators, AATBioquest IC50 Calculator and the Very Simple IC50 Tool Kit, both of which also give a relative IC50 value of 439.82 nM.\nWhat does that mean graphically? We will generate a box to highlight the Relative IC50 value first. For this we can use the ‚Äúx_concentration‚Äù parameter, which will take in the input concentration of interest and draw a box between the X and Y axis with the curve at the intersection. In this case, we will highlight the Relative IC50 value (439.82 nM).\n\nabsolute = PlotCurve(good_example_df)\nfigure = absolute.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                    response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                    plot_title='Relative IC50 Value',\n                                    drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                    xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                    ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                    legend=True,\n                                    box=True,\n                                    box_color='red',\n                                    x_concentration=0.43982, # the IC50 value must be in same units as label\n                                    figsize=(6.4, 4.8))\n\nplt.grid(visible=False) # Bug in code. will automatically turn off grid lines in future release\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\nBox X intersection:  0.43982\nBox Y intersection:  42.54657828956122\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the box is not at the 50% mark on the Y-Axis. Actually it is roughly 42.55% according to the output. Again, we can check this using the AATBioquest IC50 calculator, which gives an inhibition response of 42.61% for the relative IC50 value. This data is in agreement with each other, where the IC50 value calculated is the Relative IC50 value.\nWhat if we are interested at exactly 50%? This number will be the Absolute IC50 value. We can calculate that easily with the ‚Äúcalculate_absolute_ic50‚Äù function. The exact Absolute IC50 value can also be highlighted using the ‚ÄòBox=True‚Äô parameter and removing the ‚Äòx_concentration=‚Äô parameter. By default, this argument will draw the box at 50% response.\nBear in mind - Absolute IC50 in this case is relative to the input dataset. Like the relative IC50 value, it can change depending on a number of factors.\nThe Absolute IC50 for this dataset can be calculated and plotted as follows:\n\nabsolute_ic50 = good_example.calculate_absolute_ic50(name_col='Compound Name', concentration_col='Compound Conc', response_col='% Inhibition Avg')\nabsolute_ic50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound_name\nmaximum\nminimum\nrelative ic50 (nM)\nabsolute ic50 (nM)\nhill_slope\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n92.854428\n-7.640263\n439.823988\n585.470361\n1.040875\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsolute = PlotCurve(good_example_df)\nfigure = absolute.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                    response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                    plot_title='Absolute IC50 Value',\n                                    drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                    xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                    ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                    legend=True,\n                                    box=True,\n                                    box_color='red',\n                                    xscale_unit='¬µM',\n                                    box_intercept=50,\n                                    figsize=(6.4, 4.8))\n\nplt.grid(visible=False) # Hide plot gridlines \n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concentration for the at the Absolute IC50 will be 585.47 in this case. Again, it can be double checked using the AATBioquest IC50 calculator. When searching for the concentration at 50 on the Y-axis, we see X-axis value of 584.72, similar to our calculated Absolute IC50 table.  \n\n\nWhy go through all of this?\nIC50 is ambiguous. There are a lot of factors that can influence the final results. It can also be impacted by the experimental design. The minimum number of concentrations needed to calculate IC50 is two, however there are varying methods that can result in varying numbers. py50, for example, requires at least 4 datapoints to calculate the IC50. Typically, the more concentrations tested the better and more accurate the calculated IC50 will be. We can see another example here, where we tested a drug at five different concentrations.\n\nconfusing_example_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/py50/absolute_example.csv')\nconfusing_example = Calculate(confusing_example_df)\nconfusing_example.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nSay Wha Drug?\n10000\n70\n71\n70\n\n\n1\nSay Wha Drug?\n3000\n61\n59\n60\n\n\n2\nSay Wha Drug?\n1000\n42\n44\n43\n\n\n3\nSay Wha Drug?\n300\n25\n24\n24\n\n\n4\nSay Wha Drug?\n100\n9\n10\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconfusing_absolute = confusing_example.calculate_absolute_ic50(name_col='Compound Name', concentration_col='Compound Conc', response_col='% Inhibition Avg') \nconfusing_absolute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound_name\nmaximum\nminimum\nrelative ic50 (nM)\nabsolute ic50 (nM)\nhill_slope\n\n\n\n\n0\nSay Wha Drug?\n78.113654\n-3.368611\n694.869229\n1499.402853\n0.834368\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that with this example, the Relative IC50 and the Absolute IC50 values vary greatly, with the Relative being in the nM and Absolute being in the ¬µM range. A huge difference! We also see similar calculations when using hte AATBioquest IC50 calculator. When we check the values on a graph, we can see some disheartening results.\n\ntest = PlotCurve(confusing_example_df)\nfigure = test.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                plot_title='Confusing Drug',\n                                drug_name='Say Wha Drug?',\n                                xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                legend=True,\n                                xscale_unit='¬µM',\n                                xscale_ticks=(-2.5, 2.5),\n                                line_color='black',\n                                box=True,\n                                box_color='red',\n                                x_concentration=0.69487,\n                                figsize = (6.4, 4.8))\n\nplt.grid(visible=False) # Hide plot gridlines \n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n¬µM with ticks constraints!\nBox X intersection:  0.69487\nBox Y intersection:  37.34581340839601\n\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, the Relative IC50 for the Say Wha Drug? is closer to 37.3%. As personal preference, I do not think this is indicative of the meaning for ‚ÄúIC50‚Äù. When the box is plotted for the Absolute IC50 below, we see a more reasonable graph representation. More specifically, if we look at the data, the Absolute IC50 would make more sense in relation to the data as the 50% inhibition would be located somewhere between 3000 and 1000 nM (See Table in cell 8).\n\nfigure = test.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                plot_title='Confusing Drug',\n                                drug_name='Say Wha Drug?',\n                                xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                legend=True,\n                                xscale_unit='¬µM',\n                                xscale_ticks=(-2.5, 2.5),\n                                line_color='black',\n                                box=True,\n                                box_color='red',\n                                x_concentration=1.49940,\n                                figsize = (6.4, 4.8))\n\nplt.grid(visible=False) # Hide plot gridlines \n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n¬µM with ticks constraints!\nBox X intersection:  1.4994\nBox Y intersection:  50.01145250771091\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we fix this?\nThe easiest fix would be to increase the number of concetnrations tested for the drug. More points, especially at the end of the plateau, would help give a better indication of the drug potency. Here we will add 2 additional concentration points to our test and calculate the Relative and Absolute IC50 Values\n\nnew_conc = [{'Compound Name':'Say Wha Drug?', 'Compound Conc':10, '% Inhibition Avg': 8},\n            {'Compound Name':'Say Wha Drug?', 'Compound Conc':100000, '% Inhibition Avg': 90}]\n\nconfusing_example_df = pd.concat([confusing_example_df, pd.DataFrame(new_conc)], ignore_index=True)\nconfusing_example_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nSay Wha Drug?\n10000\n70.0\n71.0\n70\n\n\n1\nSay Wha Drug?\n3000\n61.0\n59.0\n60\n\n\n2\nSay Wha Drug?\n1000\n42.0\n44.0\n43\n\n\n3\nSay Wha Drug?\n300\n25.0\n24.0\n24\n\n\n4\nSay Wha Drug?\n100\n9.0\n10.0\n10\n\n\n5\nSay Wha Drug?\n10\nNaN\nNaN\n8\n\n\n6\nSay Wha Drug?\n100000\nNaN\nNaN\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample = Calculate(confusing_example_df)\nexample_ic50 = example.calculate_absolute_ic50(name_col='Compound Name', concentration_col='Compound Conc', response_col='% Inhibition Avg')\nexample_ic50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound_name\nmaximum\nminimum\nrelative ic50 (nM)\nabsolute ic50 (nM)\nhill_slope\n\n\n\n\n0\nSay Wha Drug?\n92.497681\n3.325575\n1563.735262\n1782.84356\n0.723894\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the new table, you can see that adding more points will adjust both the Relative and Absolute IC50 values. But if we were to increase the number of concentrations tested, the two values will begin to move closer to each other. Again, this appear to be reasonable due to the Inhibition average of the dataset, where 50% inhibition should fall somewhere between the 1000 and 3000 nM concentration. This will also change the way the graph looks as follows:\n\nexample_plot = PlotCurve(confusing_example_df)\nfigure = example_plot.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                        response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                        plot_title='Confusing Drug with More Data Points',\n                                        drug_name='Say Wha Drug?',\n                                        xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                        ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                        legend=False,\n                                        xscale_unit='¬µM',\n                                        xscale_ticks=(-2.5, 2.5),\n                                        line_color='black',\n                                        box=True,\n                                        x_concentration=1.563735262, # Highlight Relative IC50 \n                                        box_color='red',\n                                        figsize=(6.4, 4.8))\n\nplt.grid(visible=False) # Hide plot gridlines \n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n¬µM with ticks constraints!\nBox X intersection:  1.563735262\nBox Y intersection:  47.88712123918891\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the AATBioquest IC50 calculator, if you are feeling adventurous, can be used ot double check the the above results. Both the Relative (1563.74 nM) and Absolute IC50 (1782.84 nM) values are closer to the 50% response, with the Relative IC50 increasing to 47.89% response for this example. These results are also reasonable due to the dataset on hand.\n\n\n\nTakeaway\nIC50 values can be confusing. In general, the more concentration points to obtain the plateau for 0% and 100% responses, the better. However, assays can vary by lab and by protocols. The best thing to do is to remember to take stock of your final dataset. Know where the 50% response should lay within your dataset and to make sure that the final calculated (Relative or Absolute) IC50 value makes sense for the data on hand. Remember that the calculated value is representative of the dataset on hand and not the definite result.\nüçæRemember: Use your best judgement.üéâ"

Well, a series of life choices fresh from university led me there. I did not get a start into my field of study overnight. I am a late bloomer. And still learning. Or at least trying to!\nI specialize in cheminformatics - using computers to sort and categorize molecules. There‚Äôs a lot of good software out there that can help anyone interested into getting into the field. That includes both paid versions, such as Schrodiner‚Äôs Maestro, or open source software such as the wonderful suite available from the University of Hamburg. Those tools are great! But I quickly realized that relying on software, as good as they can be, can be very limiting. What if I have an idea that does not fit the available software? What if I want to make modifications to the figures I make? What if I want to try a new screening protocol? There is only one way to do these things - coding! And learning to code requires a lot of practice.\nI know that with experience. I have tried learning ot code multiple times in my life. Each time I have failed. There is a whole host of reasons. Maybe the language I chose was not for me. Java, is great, but at the time I can barely wrap my head around it. I tried making a small iOS app in the early days of the iPhone, which used UIKit. No dice. When Apple transitioned into Swift UI, I thought ‚ÄúGreat! A new start!‚Äù Only to fail horribly.\nIt was not until I got into the Ph.D.¬†program (and again, I started late!) that I finally tried and‚Ä¶ well I did not succeed, but I got way further than before.\nWhat helped was having a project and actually sticking with it. Well, what really helped is that I found a lot of examples online tackling similar problems I had. People writing about their code, sharing new tools and packages, and how to solve them. All of this helped make things simple enough for me to at least get started.\nFor that, I am forever grateful.\nThat brings me to this blog. I will use it as a place to practice coding, my thinking and thought processes, what I am interested in, and hopefully, as a way to share with others.\nThis will be my way of paying it forward.\nAnd barring that, it will be a good place to showcase my failures to the world. I‚Äôm ok with that too."

You can access it here\n\nExample start\nFirst import the modules and the dataset.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom py50.calculate import Calculate\nfrom py50.plotcurve import PlotCurve\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('datasets/py50/single_example.csv')\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n100000.0\n90\n94\n92\n\n\n1\nDrug 1\n33300.0\n97\n89\n93\n\n\n2\nDrug 1\n11100.0\n86\n89\n88\n\n\n3\nDrug 1\n3700.0\n81\n88\n84\n\n\n4\nDrug 1\n1240.0\n63\n70\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate IC50\nThe example dataframe will need to be converted into an instance of the Calculate class. Once converted, the table can also be printed for viewing and checking.\n\ndata = Calculate(df)\ndata.show().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n100000.0\n90\n94\n92\n\n\n1\nDrug 1\n33300.0\n97\n89\n93\n\n\n2\nDrug 1\n11100.0\n86\n89\n88\n\n\n3\nDrug 1\n3700.0\n81\n88\n84\n\n\n4\nDrug 1\n1240.0\n63\n70\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the py50 program requires the at least 3 columns as input. The rest of the columns will be ignored. py50 requires a column containing the following: - Drug Name - Concentration - Average Response\nNote that py50 requires the average response. Though if you would like to calculate IC50 for one trial of a drug, that is possible.\nThe names for the corresponding columns can be passed in the ‚Äúcalculate_ic50()‚Äù function as follows:\n\nic50 = data.calculate_ic50(name_col='Compound Name', concentration_col='Compound Conc', response_col='% Inhibition Avg')\nic50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound_name\nmaximum\nminimum\nic50 (nM)\nhill_slope\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n92.854428\n-7.640263\n439.823988\n1.040875\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the maximum and minimum corresponds to the maximum and minimum response. The Hill slope is the hill coefficient. This table can be output as a separate .csv file. For this tutorial, we will output the final table as a markdown table.\nNOTE: The calculation in this table is the Relative IC50 value. A future post will tackle Relative vs Absolute IC50.\n\n\nPlotting\npy50 contains functions that will allow plotting. Let‚Äôs generate a sigmoidal curve from the dataset. This time the dataframe will need to be instantiated into the PlotCurve class. From there, the dataset will be calculated and the resulting information will be ploted on a graph.\n\nplot_data = PlotCurve(df)\n# The input dataset can be inspected as follows:\ndata.show().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Name\nCompound Conc\n% Inhibition 1\n% Inhibition 2\n% Inhibition Avg\n\n\n\n\n0\nDrug 1\n100000.0\n90\n94\n92\n\n\n1\nDrug 1\n33300.0\n97\n89\n93\n\n\n2\nDrug 1\n11100.0\n86\n89\n88\n\n\n3\nDrug 1\n3700.0\n81\n88\n84\n\n\n4\nDrug 1\n1240.0\n63\n70\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, plotting the dose-response curve uses the single_curve_plot() function. By default, py50 will assume drug concentrations are in nanomolar (nM) concentration and will convert them into micromolar (¬µM) concentrations. This will also mean that the final scale on the x-axis will be in ¬µM. As the dosages for a typical test vary greatly in concentrations, the scale of the concentration will be in log format by default. However, depending on user needs, these can be changed.\nAdditional parameters and their explanation can be found here.\nFirst. Here we will call the ‚Äúsingle_curve_plot‚Äù method with the associated parameters:\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='Default Plot',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize figure\nThe above figure looks great! But what if I do not like black for the line color? I would much prefer Teal (#008080). Good news! There are several ways to adjust the graph to highlight the information you want to convey. For colors, we will start with the ‚Äúline_color=‚Äù parameter. The line color can be a specific color name (i.e.¬†red, blue, green, etc) or a hex code. Here is an example of a colored line in ‚Äúteal‚Äù (#008080)\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='Plot with Colored Lines',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt look half bad! But what if you want to highlight the IC50 value? That would give people a quick way to identify where the IC50 lies on the curve. That can be achieved using the ‚Äúbox=‚Äù parameter. The box argument is a boolean argument and by default it will draw a box at the 50% response with respect to the curve.\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='Plot with Colored Lines',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     box=True,\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box highlight can be further modified for color and specific response position you may be interested in. For example, what if you want the box to be red and also highlight IC\\(_{60}\\) or IC\\(_{90}\\)? This can be achieved by using the ‚Äúbox_intercept=‚Äù and ‚Äúbox_color=‚Äù parameters\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='Plot with More Colors!',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (¬µM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     box=True,\n                                     box_intercept=60,\n                                     box_color='red',\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the x-axis can be further adjusted.\nThe scale can be changed from log to linear using the ‚Äúxscale=‚Äù argument, changing the shape of the curve from sigmoid to a normal curve. The units of the scale can be changed to nM using the ‚Äúxscale_unit=‚Äù argument. Currently only ¬µM and nM is used.\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='A Linear Plot',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (nM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     box=False,\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     xscale='linear',\n                                     xscale_unit='nM',\n                                     xscale_ticks=(-2.5, 10),\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis is in nM\nnM with ticks constraints!\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this dataset, the ‚Äúxscale=‚Äòlinear‚Äô‚Äù does not look as good.\nAlso notice how on the linear plot the xscale_ticks was also adjusted to fit the concentration in nM scale. This was achieved using the ‚Äúxscale_ticks=‚Äù argument. Note that the xscale_ticks will affect how the line curve is drawn and should be adjusted to fit the dataset on the plot. Notice how the plot below has the xscale_ticks ranging from 0 to 2 and how it would affect the resulting curve line.\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='X-Axis is Set to nM',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (nM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     box=True,\n                                     box_color='orange',\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     xscale='log',\n                                     xscale_unit='nM',\n                                     xscale_ticks=(0, 2),\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis is in nM\nnM with ticks constraints!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving the figure\nFinally, the figure can be saved using the ‚Äúoutput_filename=‚Äù argument. Change ‚ÄúNone‚Äù to file path of choice. Images should be saved in .png format.\n\nfigure = plot_data.single_curve_plot(concentration_col='Compound Conc',\n                                     response_col='% Inhibition Avg',\n                                     plot_title='X-Axis is Set to nM',\n                                     drug_name='Drug 1',\n                                     xlabel='Logarithmic Concentration (nM)',\n                                     ylabel='Inhibition %',\n                                     line_color='#008080',\n                                     box=True,\n                                     box_color='orange',\n                                     legend=True,\n                                     xscale='log',\n                                     xscale_unit='¬µM',\n                                     xscale_ticks=(-2.5, 2.5),\n                                     output_filename=None)\n\nConcentration on X-axis converted to ¬µM\n¬µM with ticks constraints!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the figure can also be saved as follows:\n\nfigure.savefig('tutorial_figure_001.png')\n\nAnd that should be it!\nThis is my first ‚Äúbig‚Äù python project and I learned a lot from it. I know I should clean up the code in the future, but for now, I‚Äôm glad to have it up and running! I plan on maintaining this for the foreseeable future. I hope it helps others as much as it has helped me!"

    "text": "py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves\nI would like to announce a new project I have been working on: py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves. It is the first ‚Äúbig‚Äù python project that I have worked on. This package will calculate IC50 (py50, get it? ‚Ä¶ Anyone?) and will plot the dose-response curves. And for anyone who does not know how to code, I created a Streamlit web application(click here). I hope others will be able to find this useful for their own work.\n\nWhy did I make py50?\nWell, this was mostly for myself. I am lucky to be in a lab that has close collaborations with other labs, meaning that my work can quickly be shared with experts in other areas. They will generate the dose-response curves for me. But sometimes when I organize my figures, I realized that the curves do not fit my style. The color does not match my docking pose, or my protein, or the font could be bigger, etc. Now, I could ask them to change it, but I do not like to be a burden on people. They spent a lot of time doing this work, the least I could do is learn the program they used to generate plot, right?\nWell, the truth is I hate using their program (which I will not name here)!\nSo I went about creating my own. As a python module, it can be customizable to anyone‚Äôs workflow. The outcome is perfect for me. After I showed this to my advisor, he made the comment that it would be good for others to use. And I realized that I could easily convert the code for this purpose.\nFor py50, I have a KNIME workflow. That is available upon request. It is not as elegant, as they are not custom KNIME nodes, so I am a little more reserved in sharing that workflow. Another issue with KNIME is that it would require the user to have python installed on their machine. I realized that could be a hassle. So I also created a Streamlit web application. Using Streamlit has been on my list of things to try for a very long time, and I am glad that with my py50 project, I was able to do that.\nThe code is not perfect. There is a lot that I need to clean up on the backend. But for what I have, it works and I learned a lot. I am very surprised I got a decent package up and running. The plan is to maintain this for the foreseeable future. And, if the inspiration is right, I will add some extra features over the coming years.\nThe next few posts will dive into details about py50, the functions, and concepts of IC50 that I ran into."
