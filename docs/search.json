    "text": "Hello World - Now with Goals\nHello everyone. My name is Tony. I am currently in a Ph.D.¬†program for drug discovery in Taiwan. Why Taiwan? Well, a series of life choices fresh from university led me there. I did not get a start into my field of study overnight. I am a late bloomer. And still learning. Or at least trying to!\nI specialize in cheminformatics - using computers to sort and categorize molecules. There‚Äôs a lot of good software out there that can help anyone interested into getting into the field. That includes both paid versions, such as Schrodiner‚Äôs Maestro, or open source software such as the wonderful suite available from the University of Hamburg. Those tools are great! But I quickly realized that relying on software, as good as they can be, can be very limiting. What if I have an idea that does not fit the available software? What if I want to make modifications to the figures I make? What if I want to try a new screening protocol? There is only one way to do these things - coding! And learning to code requires a lot of practice.\nI know that with experience. I have tried learning ot code multiple times in my life. Each time I have failed. There is a whole host of reasons. Maybe the language I chose was not for me. Java, is great, but at the time I can barely wrap my head around it. I tried making a small iOS app in the early days of the iPhone, which used UIKit. No dice. When Apple transitioned into Swift UI, I thought ‚ÄúGreat! A new start!‚Äù Only to fail horribly.\nIt was not until I got into the Ph.D.¬†program (and again, I started late!) that I finally tried and‚Ä¶ well I did not succeed, but I got way further than before.\nWhat helped was having a project and actually sticking with it. Well, what really helped is that I found a lot of examples online tackling similar problems I had. People writing about their code, sharing new tools and packages, and how to solve them. All of this helped make things simple enough for me to at least get started.\nFor that, I am forever grateful.\nThat brings me to this blog. I will use it as a place to practice coding, my thinking and thought processes, what I am interested in, and hopefully, as a way to share with others.\nThis will be my way of paying it forward.\nAnd barring that, it will be a good place to showcase my failures to the world. I‚Äôm ok with that too."

    "text": "py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves\nI would like to announce a new project I have been working on: py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves. It is the first ‚Äúbig‚Äù python project that I have worked on. This package will calculate IC50 (py50, get it? ‚Ä¶ Anyone?) and will plot the dose-response curves. And for anyone who does not know how to code, I created a Streamlit web application(click here). I hope others will be able to find this useful for their own work.\n\nWhy did I make py50?\nWell, this was mostly for myself. I am lucky to be in a lab that has close collaborations with other labs, meaning that my work can quickly be shared with experts in other areas. They will generate the dose-response curves for me. But sometimes when I organize my figures, I realized that the curves do not fit my style. The color does not match my docking pose, or my protein, or the font could be bigger, etc. Now, I could ask them to change it, but I do not like to be a burden on people. They spent a lot of time doing this work, the least I could do is learn the program they used to generate plot, right?\nWell, the truth is I hate using their program (which I will not name here)!\nSo I went about creating my own. As a python module, it can be customizable to anyone‚Äôs workflow. The outcome is perfect for me. After I showed this to my advisor, he made the comment that it would be good for others to use. And I realized that I could easily convert the code for this purpose.\nFor py50, I have a KNIME workflow. That is available upon request. It is not as elegant, as they are not custom KNIME nodes, so I am a little more reserved in sharing that workflow. Another issue with KNIME is that it would require the user to have python installed on their machine. I realized that could be a hassle. So I also created a Streamlit web application. Using Streamlit has been on my list of things to try for a very long time, and I am glad that with my py50 project, I was able to do that.\nThe code is not perfect. There is a lot that I need to clean up on the backend. But for what I have, it works and I learned a lot. I am very surprised I got a decent package up and running. The plan is to maintain this for the foreseeable future. And, if the inspiration is right, I will add some extra features over the coming years.\nThe next few posts will dive into details about py50, the functions, and concepts of IC50 that I ran into."
