Well, a series of life choices fresh from university led me there, but I did not start the program until late. I am, what you would call, a late bloomer. And still learning!\nThat brings me to this blog. I will use it as a place to practice coding, my thinking and thought processes, what I am interested in, and hopefully, as a way to share with others.\nYou can find my GitHub account here for things that I will try in the future.\nAny posts with code here will be in a Jupyter Notebook format and can be found here"
