Well I have egg on my face. Rotten eggs, so that they are unsalvageable to be used in scrambled eggs. 

Here is the story. In my [earlier post](https://tlint101.github.io/practice-in-code/posts/3-announcing-py50.html) 
I announced and in the [last post](https://tlint101.github.io/practice-in-code/posts/4-py50-single-plot.html)
I gave an example on how to use the program in python. Everything worked! The thing is, it worked **for my** datasets. 
When I shared this code/program with my co-workers/labmates, my program quickly crumbled like a dusty cracker. 
It is a good thing that I placed it as version 0.1.0. I am currently in the process of fixing the bugs and I hope to 
finish it sometime in the new year (Hey, a New Year's resolution I might actually finish for once!). 

I will be sure to give updates and tutorials on the program once I finish. 

If you would like to use the program now, I push out updates faster to the Streamlit version of py50 
([see here](https://py50-app.streamlit.app)). This web application is for my co-workers/labmates, but I hope others
are able to find it and find it useful too. 

In the meantime, I'll be working on fixing these bugs and refactoring the code so that it will be a little bit easier
to fix in the future (you're welcome future me). 

Thanks!
