    "Sometimes it can feel like science is spoken in an unknowable language. Reading figures you see symbols like Å or unit scales for the metric system that make no sense (Does \"Kangaroos Hop Down Mountains Drinking Chocolate Milk\" even work?!?!?!), especially when starting out. For communicating your work, how the data and the units are represented matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "That brings me back to IC50. I know, I have mentioned it a lot (see [here](https://tlint101.github.io/practice-in-code/posts/6-py50-QuickStart.html) and [here](https://tlint101.github.io/practice-in-code/posts/8-absolute-ic50.html)). In short, IC50 value indicates if a drug can inhibit a protein activity by 50%. It is an important indicator of how potent a drug may be. However, obtaining the IC50 value can vary in so many ways. The drug potency can also be an indication of what stage the drug is in during development pipeline. The end result makes reporting a given drug's potency muddy, especially when trying to compare potency between compounds or compare structures during the development stages. \n",

    "# A Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of how pIC50 can be used is demoed here through the development of Capivasertib (AZD5363). Capivasertib is an AKT kinase inhibitor recently approved in 2023. It is the 7th approved [fragment-derived drug](http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2023/11/capivasertib-seventh-approved-fragment.html). It was built around a 7-azaindole core and originally started with an IC50 > 100 µM for AKT. That high IC50 is typical starting point for fragment-based drug design.  Looking at the first report of Capivasertib, [published in 2013](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jm301762v), we can list the intermediate compound's and their reported IC50. From there we can scale the results to pIC50 and get a better idea of the compounds potency as it moved through the drug optimization stages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** I did not follow the optimization linearly - the IC50 varied between compounds, with some more or less potent depending on the moiety substituted and explored. From the paper, we see that the chemists were able to generate many molecules with very high potency, however issues of selectivity were of great concern, leading to a lot of tweaking. A lot of work was put into the development of Capivasertib (not just potency but selectivity!) and should not be dismissed by my simple demo."
