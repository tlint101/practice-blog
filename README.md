## Introduction
Hello there! 

My name is Tony and you have stumbled across my blog. There are a ton of blogs online that has taught me how do things 
in python. And I would like to pay it forward! This will serve as a place where I share what interests me, code that I 
am currently testing or packages that I find interesting. 

Any code that I use can be found in this repository under the 'notebooks/' directory. 

As always, thanks for visitng!
